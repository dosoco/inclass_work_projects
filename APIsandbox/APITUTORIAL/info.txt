1. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Code:
Explanation:
* Synchronous Code:
    * In synchronous code, tasks are executed one after another, in a sequence. Each task waits for the previous one to finish before starting.
    * Use Case:
        * Useful when the next step in your program relies on the result of the previous one.
* Asynchronous Code:
    * In asynchronous code, tasks can be initiated and continue without waiting for the previous ones to complete. The program doesn't halt; it proceeds to the next task while waiting for certain operations to finish.
    * Use Case:
        * Ideal for handling tasks that take time, like reading files, making API requests, or waiting for user input.
2. Promises and .then() Method:
Explanation:
    * Promise:
    * A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It is used to handle asynchronous code more elegantly.
    * Example:
let fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation (e.g., API request)
  if (operationSuccessful) {
    resolve(data); // If successful
  } else {
    reject(error); // If an error occurs
  }
});

fetchData.then(data => {
  // Code to execute when the promise is resolved
}).catch(error => {
  // Code to handle errors
});
3. Callback Hell:
Explanation:
    * Callback Hell (Pyramid of Doom):
    * Callback hell refers to the situation when you have multiple nested callbacks within each other, making the code hard to read and maintain.
    * Example:
fetchData1(() => {
  fetchData2(() => {
    fetchData3(() => {
      // ...and so on
    });
  });
});
4. Nested Asynchronous Code vs. Promises:
Explanation:
* Nested Asynchronous Code:
    * When dealing with multiple asynchronous operations, nested callbacks can lead to callback hell. It's hard to read and prone to errors.
    * Example:
fetchData1(() => {
  fetchData2(() => {
    // ...nested callbacks
  });
});
Promises:
* Promises provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous operations. They allow you to chain .then() methods, improving readability and reducing nesting.
* Example:
fetchData1()
  .then(() => fetchData2())
  .then(() => fetchData3())
  .then(() => {
    // ...code after all operations
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // ...handle errors
  });
5. Reading API Docs:
Explanation:
    * API Documentation:
    * API documentation provides information on how to interact with a particular API. Look for details on available endpoints, request methods, parameters, and response formats.
    * Steps:
            * Endpoint:
            * Identify the endpoint you want to access. It's like the URL for a specific functionality.
            * Request Method:
            * Check which HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) is used to interact with the endpoint.
            * Parameters:
            * Determine if any parameters are required or optional for the request.
            * Response Format:
            * Understand the format in which the API will return data (JSON, XML, etc.).
    * Example:
        * If you want to fetch user data, the API documentation might have an endpoint like /users with the method GET, and it may require parameters like userId. The response could be in JSON format.

1. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Code:
Example:
// Synchronous Code
function synchronousTask() {
  console.log("Start");
  console.log("Middle");
  console.log("End");
}

synchronousTask();

// Asynchronous Code
function asynchronousTask() {
  console.log("Start");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Middle (Async)");
  }, 1000);

  console.log("End");
}

asynchronousTask();
Explanation:
* In the synchronous example, each log statement runs one after another, in sequence.
* In the asynchronous example, the "Middle (Async)" log is delayed by 1000 milliseconds, but the program doesn't wait and proceeds to the next statement.
2. Promises and .then() Method:
Example:
// Promise Example
let fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let operationSuccessful = true;

  if (operationSuccessful) {
    resolve("Data Fetched!");
  } else {
    reject("Error Fetching Data");
  }
});

// Using .then() and .catch()
fetchData
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
Explanation:
* The fetchData promise represents an asynchronous operation (like fetching data from an API).
* The .then() method is used to handle the resolved state, and .catch() is used for handling errors.
3. Callback Hell:
Example:
// Nested Callbacks (Callback Hell)
fetchData1(() => {
  fetchData2(() => {
    fetchData3(() => {
      // ...nested callbacks
    });
  });
});
Explanation:
* Callback hell occurs when you have multiple nested callbacks, making the code hard to read and manage.
4. Nested Asynchronous Code vs. Promises:
Example:

// Nested Asynchronous Code
fetchData1(() => {
  fetchData2(() => {
    // ...nested callbacks
  });
});

// Using Promises
fetchData1()
  .then(() => fetchData2())
  .then(() => {
    // ...code after all operations
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // ...handle errors
  });
Explanation:
* The first example demonstrates nested asynchronous callbacks.
* The second example uses promises, making the code more readable and manageable.
5. Reading API Docs:
Example:
// API Request using Fetch API
fetch('https://api.example.com/users')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Process data from the API response
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
Explanation:
* In this example, we use the Fetch API to request data from an API endpoint (https://api.example.com/users).
* We chain .then() to handle the JSON response and another .then() for processing the data.
